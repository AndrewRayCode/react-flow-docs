It’s common knowledge that many open source projects are underfunded. We think one reason for this is that **the open source world is doing a bad job of asking for the money that it deserves.** By telling the right organizations exactly why and how we want them to financially support our work, OSS projects can be compensated for more fairly, and result in a healthier open source ecosystem.

## How we got paid fairly for our OSS

We built an open source library for making node-based UIs ([React Flow](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow)), and our story developed in a similar way to some other lucky libraries:

1. Build a library to fill a need you have and open source it
2. Gain users who have the same need, and they start submitting issues and requests
3. Build trust by continuing to maintain and develop the library as it grows
4. Open your Github sponsors page

Unfortunately our Github sponsors page didn’t pay the bills- not even close. To avoid having to do contract work or look for investors, we decided to ask for money in a more direct way by adding this to our website:

    The Free plan is the open source library as-is. The Starter and Pro plans have a few extras that
    users can pay for with a monthly subscription, like prioritized bug reports and email support.

We started getting paying customers at a _much_ faster rate, each paying more than any of our sponsors were, **and we became “ramen profitable” in a few months.**

**What caused such a drastic change?**

**How did we bypass a problem that plagues the OSS world?**

## Thin-Crust Open Core model

We moved from a donation-based model to a [Thin-Crust Open Core](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/open-source-software-strategy-benefits) model. This is why we kept the React Flow library MIT Licensed, and added a small amount of features (Pro examples, and some technical support) in the “crust” of the library. By offering something small on-top of our core library, we created a reason to click the “buy” button.

At first, we were afraid that subscribers would have high expectations from us since they were now paying for our work. We imagined monthly newsletters, frequent updates and features, rapid response times, and having to constantly prove ourselves. This didn’t turn out to be true.

From talking to our subscribers we learned that after subscribing, they don’t think of themselves as just paying for the on-top offerings with their subscription, but rather that they are paying for whole library (the docs, guides, new features, and the beautiful working app that they made with React Flow). It is true: they aren’t just paying for the stuff on top, they **_are_** paying for the whole library. For them, paying that money for the React Flow library is worth it.

## Acknowledging the funnel

Every open source project that receives money has a “purchase funnel” (the steps a person takes to become a paying customer) even if it’s just a “buy me a coffee” button. OSS projects miss out on potential funding from the right places by not acknowledging what steps a user currently goes through to become a paying user.

We added a small attribution in the corner of React Flow’s viewport. It’s easy to remove, and 100% legal to do so under our MIT License. In the code where you can remove this attribution, we link to our pricing website with the request to consider paying if they are using our library commercially.

This moment establishes some friction to the user. Even if they are able to remove it, they will nonetheless take a moment to consider if they are willing to support the library.

## Stealing from the SaaS Playbook

First, we decided who we wanted to pay for the library: Organizations (not individuals) who get value from our library, and can easily afford it.

We wish that every open source loving developer would pay us with their company’s credit card if they liked our library, but after talking to our subscribers, we know that’s not how this works. Often times they have to make a case to their project manager or CTO to ask if the company can support the project. **Our job as OSS creators is to make it easy for our users to ask their organizations to support our project.** We can do this by stealing from the SaaS playbook.

By using a three-column pricing page, the person with the credit card knows exactly what to expect when they arrived on our pricing page: cheap on the left side, expensive on the right. It says what they get, and how much it costs. We didn’t need to explain any complex donation structures, or how their money would exactly be used, which we believe might be a barrier for organizations who are easily able to afford the pricetag. This way, we helped our users to become successful liaisons when asking for budget within their organizations.

## None of this is new

Investors are [very aware](https://nautacapital.com/insight/open-source-weathers-the-fundingstorm/) of using open source as the center of a business model, it’s a way to get an interested user group, expert feedback, developer goodwill, an interest from potential hires, and a foot in the door with larger companies who adopt your OSS (which can later be sold on services or related proprietary code). Along this path, the next step of a library like ours could be to seek investment, expand our service and/or proprietary offering, and eventually seek an exit.

What we’re doing instead is staying intentionally small and slow growing. We don’t want or need to expand our proprietary offering at a pace that will outgrow the core library. Instead, we can have the benefits of being paid for our open source work, **while having total agency over the direction of the library**.

Our suggestion here is to take the models that investors are using for our own open source projects, so that we can get paid by companies and organizations, rather than a [closed ecosystem](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/01/07/open-source-has-a-funding-problem/) of open source developers paying other open source developers.

## Mileage may vary

Although we think that many people can use this to get paid more fairly for their OSS, we also acknowledge that we had a head-start in a lot of ways: before putting a pricetag on the website, we had a business set up and ready-to-go (from another project) and we had already worked on the library for two years. We were lucky that we hit a niche that is at the center of many companies with a node-based UI at the core of their product, and building a visual library made it possible to have a visible attribution in the corner that could direct our users to a pricing page.

## Some final thoughts

If you don’t feel like taking money from customers because it gives you a sense of responsibility that you don’t like, that’s also fine. There is a different kind of work that has to be done when you have not only “users,” but also “customers,” and we hear that.

Asking for money in this way takes confidence in our work. It can be difficult to ask for money for something you may have considered a hobby, or a less-than-serious project. Just because we do work “for fun” or in our “free time” doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be compensated for it. If we were all compensated for our open source work, it might even allow for people to contribute to open source who otherwise don’t have the privilege of “free time” [[link](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community)].

We hope sharing our journey can help a few people move money into the right hands.
